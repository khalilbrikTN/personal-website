          <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
          <p>
            This scholarship represents more than just an educational
            opportunity - it's a gateway to international exposure,
            cross-cultural understanding, and the development of a global
            perspective that will shape my future career in technology and
            innovation.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm excited to join a diverse community of scholars from across the
            region and beyond, to engage with world-class faculty, and to
            contribute to groundbreaking research in computer science and
            artificial intelligence. The multicultural environment at AUC will
            provide invaluable opportunities to learn from different
            perspectives and build lasting international connections.
          </p>

          <p>
            This achievement builds directly upon the strong foundation I
            established through my Baccalaureate studies in Tunisia, and I'm
            committed to making the most of this incredible opportunity. My goal
            is not only to excel academically but also to develop the leadership
            skills and global mindset that will enable me to contribute
            meaningfully to technological innovation and positive change in the
            world.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm deeply grateful to the US Department of State, MEPI, and
            everyone who supported me throughout this journey. This is just the
            beginning of an exciting new chapter, and I can't wait to see what
            the future holds! 🌟
