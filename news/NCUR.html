            <strong
              >National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR)</strong
            >
            organized by the Council on Undergraduate Research in Pittsburgh,
            Pennsylvania, where I engaged with over
            <strong>60 attendees</strong> during a dedicated two-hour poster

          <h2>About NCUR</h2>
          <p>
            The National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) is the
            premier annual event celebrating undergraduate scholarship across
            all academic disciplines. Organized by the Council on Undergraduate
            Research, NCUR provides a platform for students from universities
            nationwide to present their original research, creative works, and
            scholarly achievements to a diverse audience of peers, faculty, and
            professionals.
          </p>

          <p>
            This year's conference in Pittsburgh brought together thousands of
            undergraduate researchers, creating an inspiring environment for
            intellectual exchange and collaboration. The event featured
            presentations across multiple formats, including poster sessions,
            oral presentations, and performances, showcasing the breadth and
            depth of undergraduate research across the United States.

          <h2>My Research Presentation</h2>
          <p>
            üîç My project, titled
            <strong
              >"Using Large Language Models to Enhance Emergency Response
              Systems: A Context Awareness Approach"</strong
            >, explores how AI and Large Language Models like LLaMA 2 can
            revolutionize 911 emergency response systems by providing
            intelligent assistance to human dispatchers.
          </p>

          <h3>Research Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Classical emergency response systems face significant challenges in
            processing multiple emergency calls efficiently while maintaining
            high-quality responses. Human operators work under intense mental
            pressure, leading to potential errors in critical situations. My
            research proposes a comprehensive AI-powered system that supports
            human operators through advanced machine learning techniques.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Technical Innovations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Named Entity Recognition:</strong> Automatically
              extracting caller names and emergency addresses from voice calls
              using advanced NLP models, achieving 76.5% accuracy for address
              extraction and 48.3% for name extraction from real 911 call
              datasets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emergency Classification:</strong> Implementing a
              sophisticated classifier to detect emergency types (Medical,
              Crime, Fire, Mental Health, Hazardous Materials, etc.) using
              trained LLM models for accurate categorization and resource
              dispatch.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Modular LLM Architecture:</strong> Developing specialized
              Large Language Models for each emergency type using prompt
              engineering techniques and official emergency response manuals
              from public safety organizations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Context-Aware Recommendations:</strong> Generating
              tailored, real-time guidance by integrating medical records,
              location data, and surrounding infrastructure information for
              personalized emergency response protocols.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Monitoring operator and
              caller stress levels to support responder mental health through
              intelligent break reminders and performance evaluation metrics.
            </li>
          </ul>
