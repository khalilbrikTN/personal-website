          <h3>NCUR 2025 Research Presentation</h3>
          <p>
            ðŸŽ“ Another tremendous honor was presenting my undergraduate research
            in machine learning applications for emergency response at NCUR
            2025. This experience allowed me to engage with a wide academic
            community, learning from leading researchers and students from
            across the United States.
          </p>

          <p>
            The presentation of my work on "Using Large Language Models to
            Enhance Emergency Response Systems: A Context Awareness Approach"
            provided valuable feedback that will inform the continued
            development of this research project. The interdisciplinary nature

          <h2>Lasting Connections and Networks</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most valuable aspects of this semester has been the
            professional and academic networks I've built. The connections made
            with faculty, researchers, and fellow students will continue to
            benefit my academic and professional development long after
            returning to Cairo.
          </p>

          <p>
            These relationships have already led to ongoing research
            collaborations, mentorship opportunities, and potential pathways for
            future graduate studies or professional opportunities in the United
            States.
          </p>

          <h2>Reflection and Moving Forward</h2>
          <p>
            This semester abroad at the College of Charleston has been a
            transformative experience that has fundamentally shaped my
            understanding of academic research, interdisciplinary collaboration,
            and the global nature of scientific inquiry. The combination of
            rigorous coursework, cutting-edge research opportunities, and
            cultural immersion has prepared me for the next phases of my
            academic and professional journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            As I return to The American University in Cairo to complete my
            undergraduate studies, I carry with me not only enhanced technical
            skills and research experience but also a broader perspective on how
            computational thinking can address global challenges across multiple
            disciplines.
          </p>

          <p>
            The experience has reinforced my commitment to pursuing research
            that bridges computer science with other fields to create meaningful
            impact. Whether it's developing AI systems for emergency response,
            designing space missions to explore distant worlds, or creating
            educational technologies that enhance learning, the foundation built
            during this semester will continue to guide my future endeavors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you, College of Charleston, for an unforgettable semester that
            has truly shaped my academic and personal growth. The journey
            continues, and I'm excited to apply everything I've learned to
            future challenges and opportunities! ðŸŽ“ðŸš€
