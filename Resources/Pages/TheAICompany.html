                <p>
                    My journey in AI began five years ago when I started learning Python and traditional machine
                    learning in high school. I challenged myself through Kaggle projects, including one in which I
                    predicted COVID-19 outcomes based on the health procedures countries were implementing. That project
                    revealed how deeply interconnected data, policy, and real-world impact truly are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When ChatGPT emerged, it marked the beginning of a new direction in AI. It sparked my curiosity
                    about how large language models are actually built, leading me to dive deep into LLM architecture
                    and training. At university, I continued this path by designing an AI system for emergency response
                    as part of my research at AUC. I later presented this work in the US, where I deepened my
                    understanding of building reliable, failure-tolerant AI systems and reducing model hallucinations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During those years, I also studied software architecture. Initially, I thought it only applied to
                    traditional systems; however, I came to realize that the same principles of reliability, modularity,
                    and clear system boundaries are exactly what make AI systems work at scale. That mindset shapes how
                    I design AI today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now it's time to put these skills to work solving real business problems that impact millions of
                    people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>At The AI Company</strong>, we believe real innovation comes from strong architecture:
                    finding smart, practical system designs that solve hard problems while staying aligned with solid
                    ethical standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond building solutions, we want to create a tech community, a space for people who are curious
                    and passionate about AI to connect, learn, and grow together. Throughout this journey, we'll share
                    what we learn, the challenges we face, and the approaches we take to deliver our solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is just the beginning. Stay tuned. We'll be announcing our first project very soon.
                </p>
